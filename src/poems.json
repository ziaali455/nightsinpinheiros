      "content": "There was the method of kneeling,\na fine method, if you lived in a country\nwhere stones were smooth.\nThe women dreamed wistfully of bleached courtyards,\nhidden corners where knee fit rock.\nTheir prayers were weathered rib bones,\nsmall calcium words uttered in sequence,\nas if this shedding of syllables could somehow\nfuse them to the sky.\n\nThere were the men who had been shepherds so long\nthey walked like sheep.\nUnder the olive trees, they raised their arms—\nHear us! We have pain on earth!\nWe have so much pain there is no place to store it!\nBut the olives bobbed peacefully\nin fragrant buckets of vinegar and thyme.\nAt night the men ate heartily, flat bread and white cheese,\nand were happy in spite of the pain,\nbecause there was also happiness.\n\nSome prized the pilgrimage,\nwrapping themselves in new white linen\nto ride buses across miles of vacant sand.\nWhen they arrived at Mecca,\nthey would circle the holy places,\non foot, many times,\nthey would bend to kiss the earth\nand return, their lean faces housing mystery.\n\nWhile for certain cousins and grandmothers\nthe pilgrimage occurred daily,\nlugging water from the spring\nor balancing the baskets of grapes.\nThese were the ones present at births,\nhumming quietly to perspiring mothers.\nThe ones stitching intricate needlework into children’s dresses,\nforgetting how easily children soil clothes."
